# Password Generator (Python)

A password of a given length is generated, consisting of a combination of upper- and lower-case letters, numbers, and symbols. The user can specify the ratio of character-types in the password.

_Right now, the password generation of long passwords is __very__ slow. I'm working on optimising this!_ (It works
 reasonably well for passwords of around 30 characters; for those of 40, it's slow; for a standard, __1 Password__
 -style 64-character password, it's practically unusable.)
